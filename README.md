# Beta React Tutorial Project
This project uses React with Typescript + Vite.

This project is developed based on the Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial on [Beta ReactJS docs](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) with major modifications. 

Notable modifications include configuration menu to select board size, `PVP` and `PVE` mode, and its corresponding `PVE` options. 

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [production build](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html) and [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run preview`

Runs a preview of the production build from the `dist` folder. 
Note that you will have to run `npm run build` before running this. 
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in your browser.

For more detailed information about the preview options, please read the documentation about [Vite preview options](https://vitejs.dev/config/preview-options.html#preview-options).
